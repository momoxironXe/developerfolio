## How To Use üîß

From your command line, clone and run developer-portfolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/username/developer-portfolio

# Go into the repository
$ cd developer-portfolio

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

```
## Github Setup For Open Source Projects

### Genrate a Github personal access token using these [Instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)

Copy the token and open your developer console to convert your token to base64 so github do not revert your token when you push your token to git

```bash
# Open your developer console paste the token inside btoa
$ btoa("YOUR GITHUB TOKEN")
```

Copy your converted token and paste it in `/src/containers/project/Project.js`

```javascript
  function getRepoData() {
    const client = new ApolloClient({
      uri: "https://api.github.com/graphql",
      request: operation => {
        operation.setContext({
          headers: {
            authorization: `Bearer ${atob("YOUR CONVERTED GITHUB TOKEN")}`
          }
        });
      }
    });
```

Change username to your github username to get your projects 

```javascript
    client
      .query({
        query: gql`
          {
            repositoryOwner(login: "your github username") {
              ... on User {
                pinnedRepositories(first: 6) {
                  edges {
                    node {
                      nameWithOwner
                      description
                      forkCount
                      stargazers {
                        totalCount
                      }
                      url
                      id
                      diskUsage
                      primaryLanguage {
                        name
                        color
                      }
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
